## Creating an issue
Before creating an Issue for `features`/`bugs`/`improvements` please follow these steps:
1. search existing Issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this 1.already)
2. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please select the correct Issue type, for example bug or feature)

## Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. only ask to be assigned 1 issue at a time
1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you
1. after the Issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
1. **only** start working on this Issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you - this will prevent confusion, multiple people working on the same issue and work not being used
1. while making a pr make sure to add screenshots about the result after fixing the assigned issue
